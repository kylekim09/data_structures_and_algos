# data_structures_and_algos
A repo for myself to implementing MY way of key Data structures and Algos

Often times when following videos and examples I get lost. And there are multiple different ways of solving these sorts of problems.

I want this repo to be basically my own special approach on tackling on different data structures, and algorithms.
